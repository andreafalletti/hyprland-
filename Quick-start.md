# Quick start

After you've installed Hyprland, you can either launch it from a TTY with `hyprland` or from a login manager. Although login managers aren't officially supported, I recommend `SDDM`, as it's been working flawlessly with wayland compositors.

## Immediate

Once you log in, you'll be greeted with a yellow warning that will give you some basic keybind info of your pregenerated config.

I recommend you use the config provided in `examples/hyprland.conf` though.

Paste it into `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`

You can, of course, start from the pregenerated config if you wish to. If you want the warning to go away, remove the `autogenerated=1` line.

## Monitors

Use `hyprctl monitors` to list available outputs.

Then, you can configure your outputs with 
```
hyprctl keyword monitor NAME,RES@HZ,OFFSET,SCALE
```

`NAME` is the name of the display, e.g. `DP-1`

`RES@HZ` is the resolution and refresh rate, e.g. `1920x1080@144`

`OFFSET` is the position of the monitor, e.g. `0x0`

`SCALE` is the display scale, e.g. `1`

example command:
```
hyprctl keyword monitor DP-3,1920x1080@240,1920x0,1
```

**Warning!** These changes are **not** permanent! If you want to make those changes persist, configure your outputs in the config!
