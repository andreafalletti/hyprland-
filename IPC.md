# IPC

Hyprland exposes 2 UNIX Sockets, for controlling / getting info about Hyprland
via code / bash utilities.

## Hyprland Instance Signature (HIS)

```
echo $HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE
```

# /tmp/hypr/\[HIS\]/.socket.sock

Used for hyprctl-like requests. See the
[Hyprctl page](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/wiki/Using-hyprctl) for
commands.

basically, write `command args`.

# /tmp/hypr/\[HIS\]/.socket2.sock

Used for events. Hyprland will write to each connected client live events like
this:

`EVENT>>DATA\n` (\\n is a linebreak)

e.g.: `workspace>>2`

## Events list:

### workspace

emitted on workspace change. Is emitted ONLY when a user requests a workspace
change, and is not emitted on mouse movements (see `activemon`)

Data: WORKSPACENAME

### activemon

emitted on the active monitor being changed.

Data: MONNAME,WORKSPACENAME

### activewindow

emitted on the active window being changed.

Data: WINDOWCLASS,WINDOWTITLE

### fullscreen

emitted when a fullscreen status of a window changes.

Warning: a fullscreen event is not guaranteed to fire on/off once in succession.
A window might do for example 3 requests to be fullscreen'd, which would result
in 3 fullscreen events.

Data: 0/1 (exit fullscreen / enter fullscreen)

### monitorremoved

emitted when a monitor is removed (disconnected)

Data: MONITORNAME

### monitoradded

emitted when a monitor is added (connected)

Data: MONITORNAME

### createworkspace and destroyworkspace

emitted when a workspace is created or removed

Data: WORKSPANCENAME

## How to use socket2 with bash

example script using socket2 events with bash and `socat`:

```
#!/bin/sh

function handle {
  if [[ ${1:0:12} == "monitoradded" ]]; then
    # do_something
  fi
}

socat - UNIX-CONNECT:/tmp/hypr/$(echo $HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE)/.socket2.sock | while read line; do handle $line; done
```
