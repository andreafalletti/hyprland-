### Nothing renders / screen is empty / crash on opening first app

Possible causes:

#### Your themes are not set up properly, making apps crash.

Use something like `qt5ct` (QT) and `lxappearance` (GTK) (\*for GTK you can also
set up themes with envvars) to set up your themes.

#### Your PC is very, very old.

In that case, see the
[Installation Page](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/wiki/Installation) and
try compiling with LEGACY_RENDERER

*For more info about bugs and crashes, see this*
*[wiki page](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/wiki/Crashing-and-bugs)*

### Me cursor no render?

Are you on NVIDIA? If so, then you have been a naughty boy and haven't listened
to my tips on other pages. Use the `WLR_NO_HARDWARE_CURSORS=1` envvar.

### How do I screenshot?

Install `grim-git` and `slurp`

Use a keybind (or execute) `grim -g $(slurp)`, select a region. A screenshot
will pop into your `~/Pictures/` (You can configure grim and slurp, see their
github pages)

### How do I change my wallpaper?

Install hyprpaper, swaybg or any other wlroots-compatible wallpaper utility.

### My workspace (2, 3, or any other) is like... bugged?

You did the below, unknowingly.

### How do I mirror a screen?

Mirroring isn't *officially* supported, it's technically a bug, but it works.
Make sure the screen you want mirrored is the same resolution as the source.

Then, just make them overlap in the layout, e.g. making the primary monitor at
0x0 and the mirrored one on 0x0 as well.

That creates an issue though, as the mirrored output also *has* to have an
active workspace, and usually will be annoyingly taking 2,3 etc, while making
them unreachable. An easy fix is to assign e.g.
`workspace=MIRROREDSCREEN,name:unused` and never use it.

### How heavy is this?

Not that much heavier than Xorg. If you want maximum performance, consider
turning off the blur and animations.

### My monitor no worky!

Try changing the mode in your config. If your preferred one doesn't work, try a
lower one. A good way to list all modes is to get `wlr-randr` and do a
`wlr-randr --dryrun`

### How do I get a coredump?

*These instructions are ONLY for systemd. If you use anything else, you should
know what you're doing.*

Launch `coredumpctl` in a terminal. Press "END" on the keyboard to go to the
end. Note the **last** (the one furthest to the bottom) crash that has
`/usr/bin/Hyprland` as an executable. Remember the PID of it (the first number
after the date in a given line) exit (Ctrl+C) type `coredumpctl info PID` where
PID is the remembered PID. Send the entire thing.

### How do I update?

open a terminal where you cloned the repo.
`git pull && sudo make clear && sudo make install`

### Screenshare / OBS no worky!

Yes, hello, this is Wayland.

Amazing gist just about that:
https://gist.github.com/PowerBall253/2dea6ddf6974ba4e5d26c3139ffb7580

Please remember in OBS you need to select "Pipewire screen capture" as the
source.

### Howdy I screen lock???

Use a wayland-compatible locking utility using WLR protocols, e.g. `swaylock`.

### How do I change me mouse cursor?

Use a tool like for example `lxappearance`. Change your cursor and _restart_
Hyprland. If that doesn't work, change the config files manually according to
the
[XDG specification (Arch wiki link)](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Cursor_themes#Configuration).

Make sure to also edit `~/.config/gtk-4.0/settings.ini` and `~/.gtkrc-2.0` if
_not_ using a tool (like `lxappearance`).

Then, do a `gsettings set $gnome-schema cursor-theme 'theme-name'` and you're
all good!

### GTK Settings no work / whatever!

[https://github.com/swaywm/sway/wiki/GTK-3-settings-on-Wayland](https://github.com/swaywm/sway/wiki/GTK-3-settings-on-Wayland)

### My \[program name\] is freezing!

Make sure you have a notification daemon running, for example `dunst`. Autostart
it with the `exec-once` keyword.

### I want to use Waybar, but the workspaces don't work!

Copy the Waybar source, edit `include/factory.hpp` and add

```
#define HAVE_WLR
#define USE_EXPERIMENTAL
```

on top. If you want to also have sway modules (or any other defined in the file)
add the appropriate defines.

All `#ifdef HAVE_<thing>` can be enabled by adding `#define HAVE_<thing>` on
top.

Then compile according to the instructions on the Waybar github repo.

Use the `wlr/workspaces` module.

Please do not blame me for this, it's the Waybar dev that doesn't include
experimental in the base binary for whatever reason.

### Waybar doesn't show the active workspace!

Use the style for `#workspaces button.active`

### How do I autostart my favorite apps?

Using the window rules to assign apps to workspace you can setup a session start
script to open a bunch of applications on various workspaces. The following
method will start these apps silently (i.e. without the flickering from
workspace to workspace) and deassign the rule so that subsequent start of this
app will not start it on the initially assigned workspace (which could be a drag
if e.g. you want kitty to be started on ws 1 while you need kitty to open on any
workspace subsequently).

Put the following in your hyprdland.conf: (example)

```
windowrule=workspace 1 silent,kitty
windowrule=workspace 1 silent,Subl
windowrule=workspace 3 silent,Mailspring
windowrule=workspace 4 silent,firefox
[...]
exec-once=kitty
exec-once=subl
exec-once=mailspring
exec-once=firefox
[...]
exec-once=cleanup_after_start.sh
```

where `cleanup_after_start.sh` script contains:

```
sleep 10
hyprctl keyword windowrule "workspace unset,kitty"
hyprctl keyword windowrule "workspace unset,Subl"
hyprctl keyword windowrule "workspace unset,Mailspring"
hyprctl keyword windowrule "workspace unset,firefox"
```

in `sleep 10`, the 10 is of course only a suggestion.

### Howdy I move my favorite workspaces to a new monitor when I plug it in?

if you want workspaces to automatically go to a monitor upon connection, use the
following:

In hyprland.conf:

```
exec-once=handle_monitor_connect.sh
```

where `handle_monitor_connect.sh` is: (example)

```
#!/bin/sh

function handle {
  if [[ ${1:0:12} == "monitoradded" ]]; then
    hyprctl dispatch moveworkspacetomonitor "1 1"
    hyprctl dispatch moveworkspacetomonitor "2 1"
    hyprctl dispatch moveworkspacetomonitor "4 1"
    hyprctl dispatch moveworkspacetomonitor "5 1"
  fi
}

socat - UNIX-CONNECT:/tmp/hypr/.socket2.sock | while read line; do handle $line; done
```

if you want workspaces 1 2 4 5 to go to monitor 1 when connecting it.

Please note this requires `socat` to be installed.

### My tablet no worky??

Use [Open Tablet Driver](https://github.com/OpenTabletDriver/OpenTabletDriver)
to configure your tablet. In the future it will be supported in the config.
Until then, OTD.

### Some of my apps take a really long time to open...?

*~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf*

```
exec-once=systemctl --user import-environment WAYLAND_DISPLAY XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP
```

### My cursor in QT apps is too big!

The QT cursor size can be fixed by setting the envvar `XCURSOR_SIZE=24`. You
should probably add it to your exported envvars.

### How do I export envvars for Hyprland?

As with any Display Server, Xorg included, you should probably make a script to
launch it, for example:

```
export AMONG_US=1
exec Hyprland
```

and launch that. (For Login Manager users, you can replace the "exec" entry in
the .desktop file to point to your script)

### I get random white flashes!

Try disabling VFR with `misc:no_vfr=1`
