# Configuring

The config is located in `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`.

I recommend you copy the `examples/hyprland.conf`, but you can also edit the
autogenerated config.

By removing the line `autogenerated=1` you'll remove the yellow warning.

The Hyprland config is very similiar in syntax to the Hypr config. The only
difference is that all the variables that didn't have a section are now in the
section `general`.

There is no "reload" keybind. The config is reloaded the moment you save it.

Refer to the example config in `/examples/hyprland.conf` to see, well... an
example.

Start a section with `name {` and end in `}` ***in separate lines!***

# Line style

every config line is a command followed by a value.

```
COMMAND=VALUE
```

The command can be a variable, or a special keyword (described further in this
page)

You are **allowed to** input trailing spaces at the beginning and end.

e.g.:

```
COMMAND = VALUE
```

is valid.

# Basic configuring

To configure the "options" of Hyprland, animations, styling, etc. see
[Basic Configuring](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/wiki/Basic-Config).

# Advanced configuring

Some keywords (binds, curves, execs, monitors, etc.) arent variables but define
special behaviour.

See all of them in
[Advanced Configuring](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/wiki/Advanced-config)
