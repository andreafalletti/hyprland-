# Configuring

The config is located in `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`.

I recommend you copy the `examples/hyprland.conf`, but you can also edit the autogenerated config.

By removing the line `autogenerated=1` you'll remove the yellow warning.

The Hyprland config is very similiar in syntax to the Hypr config. The only difference is that all the variables that didn't have a section are now in the section `general`.

Refer to the example config in `/examples/hyprland.conf` to see, well... and example.

Start a section with `name {` and end in `}` ***in separate lines!***

# Line style
every config line is a command followed by a value.
```
COMMAND=VALUE
```

The command can be a variable, or a special keyword (described further in this page)

You are **allowed to** input trailing spaces at the beginning and end.

e.g.:
```
COMMAND = VALUE
```
is valid.

# Variable types
Variable types are:

`int` - integer

`float` - floating point number

`col` - color (e.g. 0x22334455 - alpha 0x22, red 0x33, green 0x44, blue 0x55)

`MOD` - a string modmask (e.g. SUPER or SUPERSHIFT or SUPERSHIFTALTCTLRCAPSMOD2MOD3MOD5 or empty for none)

Mod list:
```
SHIFT CAPS CTRL/CONTROL ALT MOD2 MOD3 SUPER/WIN/LOGO/MOD4 MOD5
```

# Sections

## General
`max_fps=int` - Maximum refreshes per second. (of config, animations, hyprctl)

`sensitivity=float` - mouse sensitivity

`apply_sens_to_raw=int` - (0/1) if on, will also apply the sensitivity to raw mouse output (e.g. sensitivity in games)

`main_mod=MOD` - the mod used to move/resize floating windows (hold main_mod and mouse1/mouse2)

`border_size=int` - border thickness

`gaps_in=int` - gaps between windows

`gaps_out=int` - gaps between window-monitor edge

`col.active_border=col` - self-explanatory

`col.inactive_border=col` - self-explanatory

`damage_tracking=str` - Makes the compositor redraw only the needed bits of the display. Saves on resources by not redrawing when not needed. Available modes: `none, monitor, full`. WARNING: Damage tracking is still experimental, expect bugs, especially with `full`!

Recommended: `monitor`.

## Decoration

`rounding=int` - rounded corners radius (in pixels)

`active_opacity=float` - self-explanatory, 0 - 1

`inactive_opacity=float` - self-explanatory, 0 - 1

`blur=int` - (0/1) enable window background blur

`blur_size=int` - Minimum 2, blur size (intensity)

`blur_passes=int` - Minimim 1, more passes = more resource intensive.
    
Your blur "amount" is blur_size * blur_passes, but high blur_size (over around 30-ish) will produce artifacts.
    
If you want heavy blur, you need to up the blur_passes.

Don't set blur_passes over 3, unless you want to cook some food on your GPU. (lol)

## Animations

`enabled=int` - (0/1) enable animations

`windows=int` - (0/1) enable window animations

`borders=int` - (0/1) enable border animations

`speed=float` - Speed of the animations, more = slower.

`xxx_speed=float` - replace xxx with a component name (windows/borders) and it will apply a speed to that component. 0 means use the global value. If not set, will use the global value. (global is `speed=float`)

## Input

`kb_layout=str` `kb_variant=str` `kb_model=str` `kb_options=str` `kb_rules=str` - adequate keyboard settings

`follow_mouse=int` - (0/1) enable mouse following (focus on enter new window) - Quirk: will always focus on mouse enter if you're entering a floating window from a tiled one, or vice versa.

`repeat_rate=int` - in ms, the repeat rate for held keys

`repeat_delay=int` - in ms, the repeat delay (grace period) before the spam

### Touchpad
_Subcategory input:touchpad:_

`disable_while_typing=int` - (0/1) disable touchpad while typing

## More 
There are more config options described in other pages, which are layout- or circumstance-specific

# Special keywords

Some keywords arent variables but define special behaviour.

## Monitors
```
monitor=name,res,offset,mfactor,scale
```

for example:
```
monitor=DP-1,1920x1080@144,0x0,0.5,1
```
will tell Hyprland to make the monitor on DP-1 a 1920x1080 display, at 144Hz, 0x0 off from the beginning, with 0.5 mfactor and a scale of 1.

To disable a monitor, use
```
monitor=name,disable
```

_Warning:_ Monitor rules applied live can occasionally crash the compositor! (live = when the compositor is running, you change the monitor rule and save to reload)

```
workspace=name,number
```
for example:
```
workspace=DP-1,1
```
will tell Hyprland to make the default workspace on DP-1 a number 1.

## Binds
```
bind=MOD,key,dispatcher,params
```
for example,
```
bind=SUPERSHIFT,Q,exec,firefox
```
will bind opening firefox to SUPER+SHIFT+Q

Please note that `SHIFT` modifies the key names, so for example
```
bind=SHIFT,1,anything,
```
will not work, as 1 is overwritten by !

Common overwrites:
```
1 -> exclam
2 -> at
3 -> numbersign
4 -> dollar
5 -> percent
6 -> asciicircum
7 -> ampersand
8 -> asterisk
9 -> parenleft
0 -> parenright
- -> underscore
= -> plus
```

See the [xkbcommon-keysyms.h header](https://github.com/xkbcommon/libxkbcommon/blob/master/include/xkbcommon/xkbcommon-keysyms.h) for all the keysyms. The name you should use is the one after XKB_KEY_, written in all lowercase.


General dispatcher list:
```
exec - executes a shell command - params: command
killactive - kills the focused window - params: none
workspace - changes the workspace - params: workspace (see below)
movetoworkspace - moves the focused window to workspace X - params: workspace (see below)
togglefloating - toggles the focused window floating - params: none
fullscreen - toggles the focused window's fullscreen state - params: none
pseudo - toggles the focused window to be pseudotiled - params: none
movefocus - moves the focus in a specified direction - params: l/r/u/d (left right up down)
movewindow - moves the active window in a specified direction - params: l/r/u/d (left right up down)
splitratio - changes the split ratio - params: relative split change, +n/-n, e.g. +0.1 or -0.02, clamps to 0.1 - 1.9
```

### Workspaces
workspace args are unified. You have three choices:

ID: e.g. `1`, `2`, or `3`
Relative ID: e.g. `+1`, `-3` or `+100`
Name: e.g. `name:Web`, `name:Adult content` or `name:Anime`

## Executing
you can execute a shell script on startup of the WM or on each time it's reloaded

`exec-once=command` will execute only on launch

`exec=command` will execute on each reload
